#Assignment 1
##Computer Science II (CPS209)

For the first assignment of CPS209, I designed a game in Java, using Swing and paint methods, to create a game which resembles Pacman. The purpose of this assigment was to demonstrate polymorphism using the "Creature", "Predator" and "Prey" classes.

This application can be launched from the "GameWindow" class.
